# Nueral Network foundational architecture Development

#  `Deep nueral Network` in depth architecture plus `Generative Models` foundations
###### The Framework module is built on top of Pytorch framework to add custom built libraries 
> The Custom built framework script file is `n_framework.py`

> behind the foundational structure and Knowledge how pytorch builtin algorthms and modules are built
> How they are defined and `WHY` and `HOW` they are factorized to run faster and in Parallel for GPU optimazation
